Complete Guide to Automating Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform on AWS

In this guide, we will walk through automating the provisioning of AWS resources using Terraform instead of AWS CloudFormation. Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure in a declarative way.

We'll cover setting up Terraform, writing infrastructure code, and automating updates for AWS resources such as EC2, S3, VPC, and RDS.
